# "The World's Hardest Game" in pygame
<div align="center"><img src="demo1.gif"></div>
If you are bored with usual games,
then I suggest you a game, that
much more hard than any other game
you've ever played or will play.

There are 10 levels that you can
try to complete with no deaths. 
But if you think this is too little,
then you can create your own one
with the [Mapmaker guide](docs/Mapmaker%20guide.md)!
